# Conclusion:
## Comments on dataset:
* The models perform well in predicting the class 0 i.e. customer not subscribing to term deposit which can be seen in the confusion matrix of all models. 
* The models do not perform well in predicting the class 1 i.e. customer subscribing to term deposit which can be seen in the confusion matrix of all models. 
* Above situation occured because the Dataset is imbalanced. i.e. The ratio difference between class 0 and class 1 is huge. Which trained models to effectively identify class 0 but did not train suffuiciently to classify class 1.
* This situation could have been avoided if the datset was balanced. 
* Along with imbalance, the dataset contained large number of unknown string values in 'job','education','contact' and 'poutcome' columns.

## Comments on  Models:
* When benchmarking with 'duration' column, Support Vector Classifier achieved 90% model accuracy while naive bayes score was 85% accurate.
* SVC Perfomed better because of it's capabality of creating multiple hpyerplanes and then classifying the data.
* After removing the 'duration' column, The highest model score dropped by 0.5%.
* The Outliers did not affect much on accuracy scores of all models. As can be seen in above accuracy scores, getting rid of outliers by mean/median replacement did not affect the scores.
* In Decision Trees, Gradient boosting method always performed better for this dataset.
* While visualizing Decision Tree, The Pruned decision tree was easy to visualize as it had lesser leaf nodes than Tree which was not pruned.

## Miscellaneous Comments:
* After trying get_dummies the score did not show significant difference as well as I have skipped the get_dummies step because the dataset was creating more dimension, which was making the project more computationally intensive.
* If I had kept get_dummies step, then in production stage if the new dataset turned out to be huge in number of rows then this project would have taken a lot of time to execute.
* Outlier handeling did not make any significant difference in the accuracy scores of models.
* I have tried to keep minimum time complexity of this project.
